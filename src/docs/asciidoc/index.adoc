[[overview]]
== Overview

Bingous Auth API는 사용자 인증 및 회원가입을 위한 RESTful API입니다.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-errors]]
=== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

[[architecture]]
== Architecture

[[architecture-overview]]
=== Overview

The Auth API follows a reactive programming model using Spring WebFlux and follows these architectural principles:

* **Reactive Streams**: All operations are non-blocking and use Reactor's `Mono` and `Flux`
* **Functional Programming**: Uses functional router functions instead of traditional controllers
* **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between Router, Handler, Service, and Repository layers

[[architecture-components]]
=== Components

[[architecture-components-router]]
==== Router

The `AuthRouter` class defines the routing configuration for authentication endpoints.

[[architecture-components-handler]]
==== Handler

The `AuthHandler` class handles HTTP requests and responses:

* Validates incoming requests
* Calls appropriate service methods
* Handles errors and exceptions
* Returns proper HTTP responses

[[architecture-components-service]]
==== Service

The `AuthService` class contains business logic:

* Processes authentication requests
* Integrates with external services (email, Redis)
* Handles business rules and validation

[[development]]
== Development

[[development-setup]]
=== Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
- Java 17
- Gradle 7.x
- Redis server
- MariaDB database

2. **Environment Variables**:
bash export REDIS_HOST=localhost export REDIS_PORT=6379 export DB_HOST=localhost export DB_PORT=3306 export DB_NAME=bingous export DB_USER=your_username export DB_PASSWORD=your_password

3. **Build and Run**:
bash ./gradlew build ./gradlew bootRun
[[development-testing]]
=== Testing

[[development-testing-unit]]
==== Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in `src/test/java` and use:

* JUnit 5
* Mockito for mocking
* Reactor Test for reactive testing

[[development-testing-integration]]
==== Integration Tests

Integration tests use Spring Boot Test with WebTestClient for testing reactive endpoints.

[[development-documentation]]
=== Documentation

Documentation is generated using Spring REST Docs and Asciidoctor:

1. **Generate Documentation**:yaml logging: level: dev.gunho.api: DEBUG
java Hooks.onOperatorDebug();
3. **Monitor Reactive Streams**:
java return service.process(request) .doOnSubscribe(s -> log.debug("Processing started")) .doOnSuccess(result -> log.debug("Processing completed: {}", result)) .doOnError(error -> log.error("Processing failed", error));
